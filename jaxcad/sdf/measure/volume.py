    """Estimate the volume of an SDF as a differentiable JAX scalar.

    Uses a smooth sigmoid indicator σ(−d/ε) as a soft approximation of the
    interior indicator (1 where d < 0, 0 where d > 0).  The result is
    differentiable with respect to any free parameters of the SDF.

    Args:
        sdf:        The SDF to measure.
        bounds:     Lower corner (x, y, z) of the sampling box.
        size:       Extent (dx, dy, dz) of the sampling box.
        resolution: Number of samples per axis (resolution³ total).
        epsilon:    Smoothing width.  Smaller → sharper / more accurate;
                    larger → smoother gradients.

    Returns:
        Differentiable scalar volume estimate.
